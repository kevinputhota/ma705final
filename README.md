# MA705 Final Project

This repository contains files used in the MA705 dashboard project.

# Dashboard Description

1. The dashboard helps people choose the right diet and nutritional values from the worlds largest fast food chain : *McDonalds*
2. It also gives recommendations on what to select in a tabular form and the next time one goes to McDonalds, the wait time and confusion can easily be addressed as it helps to be well prepared.
3. I also tried to identify key resources for everyday consumption : Calories, Proteins, Fat, Sugars, Carbs.

### Data Sources

The dataset was obtained from kaggle.com and cleansed through Microsoft Excel.
